# TO DO
'''
-Do this step first. Get a few products in a simple database in Neon
-Connect back-end to the table (django -> NEON -> Django)
-Setup a query after clicking a product group to load (SMARC only)
-After page load, display table 

So page load will prompt the API call, then front end will render the content in a table.
